### Plan:
1. **Improve User Feedback**:
   - Enhance the error handling in the `connectWallet` function to provide clearer feedback to the user when the connection fails, especially if the user denies access.

2. **Check MetaMask Installation**:
   - Ensure that the application checks for the presence of MetaMask and prompts the user to install it if not found. This can be done in the `getProvider` function.

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Verify that the contract address and network configuration in `hardhat.config.js` match the network that MetaMask is connected to. If necessary, provide instructions to the user on how to switch networks in MetaMask.

4. **Testing**:
   - After implementing the changes, test the wallet connection functionality to ensure it works as expected. This includes checking for successful connections and handling errors gracefully.

### Follow-Up Steps:
- Implement the changes in the relevant files.
- Test the wallet connection functionality.
- Confirm with the user if any additional modifications are needed.
